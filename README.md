Some code handles creation of AWS Lambda functions and modification of the Tiff images in AWS S3 buckets.

Technical stack:

Java8, Maven 3

AWS Java SDK, Lambda Java Core;

Apache Imaging Project, Java Advanced Imaging.

I used the Eclipse plugin: AWS toolkit to create and edit my lambda function code.
